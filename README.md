# TSA_GAN
Time Series Analysis Final Project

Implemented a recurrent conditional generative adversarial network (RCGAN). The model learns to generates EEG time series data by fooling a discriminator.

This repository supports several different options, such as using a feed forward or RNN discriminator as well as using conditional noise as input.

# Requirements
- Python 3.7.2
- PyTorch 1.0.1
